The approach works through three repeating steps: **Thought** (the agent reasons about what it knows and what to do next), **Action** (it executes a concrete step like searching the web or calling a tool), and **Observation** (it receives and processes the results). This thought-action-observation loop continues until the agent gathers enough information to complete the task.\n",

The agent doesn’t just blindly answer a question — it thinks step by step, decides which tool (or knowledge source) to use, executes the action, observes the result, and continues reasoning if necessary. This approach is particularly powerful for complex tasks, such as multi-step math, data queries, or planning, where the model alone might make errors."

He is part of the Avatar: The Last Airbender world. The character and the series, a sequel to Avatar: The Last Airbender, were created by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko. He is voiced by David Faustino. Because he is a firebender, Mako is able to create and manipulate the classical element of fire. Mako also has the ability to both generate and redirect lightning.

In efforts to be more eco-friendly, the park uses biodegradable paper straws and prohibits plastic straws, lids, and balloons.

Special designs and provisions were incorporated throughout the park to protect the animals' welfare. The park is located on the western edge of the resort and is isolated from the other theme parks and properties to minimize external disruptions to the animals; as a result, the park does not feature nighttime fireworks shows that would otherwise disturb the animals. In efforts to be more eco-friendly, the park uses biodegradable paper straws and prohibits plastic straws, lids, and balloons. Disney's Animal Kingdom is accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums and the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums, indicating they have met or exceeded the standards in animal welfare, education, conservation, and research.\n",
